Synopsis
========

nbt2yaml presents a Python parser/writer for Minecraft NBT files.   It then includes a system that can marshal
this format to/from Yaml files.   Finally, it provides simple shell commands to provide these transformations,
including ``editnbt``, which will shell out the Yaml version of the file to your editor of choice, allowing
easy command-line editing of NBT files.

NBT format:  http://www.minecraft.net/docs/NBT.txt
Yaml: http://www.yaml.org/

Installation
============

Install via pip is easiest::

    pip install http://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/nbt2yaml

Once installed, the ``nbtedit``, ``nbt2yaml``, and ``yaml2nbt`` commands
should be available, from the same place other Python utilities are installed.

Commands
========

Note that an nbt file is typically in gzip format.  nbt2yaml commands
will assume gzip format for all nbt files written and read, unless the ``--no-gzip``
flag is specified.

For the ``nbt2yaml`` and ``yaml2nbt`` commands, the filename can be specified as ``-``,
which indicates the data should be read from standard input.

nbtedit
--------

Edits an nbt file in-place, allowing Yaml format within the editor.

The script uses the standard ``EDITOR`` environment variable to determine which
text editor should be invoked.

Synopsis::

    usage: nbtedit [-h] [-n] filename

    Edit an nbt file in-place in Yaml format.

    positional arguments:

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -n, --no-gzip  Don't use gzip

nbt2yaml
--------

Dumps an nbt file as yaml to standard output::

    usage: nbt2yaml [-h] [-n] filename

    Dump an nbt file or stream to yaml.

    positional arguments:
      filename       Filename. Specify as '-' to read from stdin.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -n, --no-gzip  Don't use gzip

yaml2nbt
--------

Dumps a yaml file generated by nbt2yaml as nbt to standard output::

    usage: yaml2nbt [-h] [-n] filename

    Dump a yaml file or stream to nbt.
